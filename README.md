<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to test some of the libraries included in the project and, also, the idea of doing a simple chat application just sounded fun!

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Acemanu412/Manu-chat.git
```
2. Go to the server folder of the project.
```sh
cd /path/to/project/server
```

3. Install server NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```

4. Go to the client folder of the project.
```sh
cd /path/to/project/client
```

5. Install client NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Run the server by going to the server folder and running:
```sh
npm run start
```
Then do the same for the client.

A tab should open in localhost:8080 with the app running on it.

Just chat away!
